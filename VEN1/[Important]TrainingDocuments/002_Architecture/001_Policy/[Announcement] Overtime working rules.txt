[Announcement] Overtime working rules
---------------------------------------
Remind for new member

Hi IBS Global (Okinawa and Vietnam) all

Firstly, I want to say apologies about global team regulation.
As you already know, IBS global still has some issues.
Especially we didn't define some working regulations in global team.
Because our current phase is try and error. Then I want to define it step by step.

This time I want to define "overtime working rules".

=====================================
1. Team member can't work overtime without team leader's approval.
2. If team member needs work overtime, negotiate with team leader before 4 PM.
3. If team leader needs work overtime of member, request to team member before 4 PM.
4. If team member work overtime, team leader report it to Nakamoto-san, Furuki-san and Satoyoshi before 5PM by e-mail.
=====================================

Basically, I don't allow work overtime.
Because if we manage work excellently, we don't need work overtime.
In addition, I hope everyone spend a lot of time with family.

Best regards,

satoyoshi
